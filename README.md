# Adversarial Detector

This implements the baseline from [On Detecting Adversarial Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04267) - Jan Hendrik Metzen, Tim Genewein, Volker Fischer, Bastian Bischoff.

The code for this is available in `detector/`. Refer to [Readme file](detector/README.md) inside for more details.

# Adversarial Data Generation

In the `adv_generation` folder. The original code for this is from https://github.com/sanilpande/adversarial-defense. Slight modifications were made to use the FGSM based generator on the other classifier models.
